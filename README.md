# [Rezerve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rezerv-gym-wellness-sports/id1661249713)
My most recent app released on the App Store is Rezerv: Gym, Wellness & Sports. I built this app from the ground up using SwiftUI, focusing on clean UI, smooth user experience, and practical functionality.
Rezerv was created to solve a real-world problem—making it easier for users to discover and reserve sessions at gyms, wellness centers, and sports facilities. Key features include:
- Search & Book: Browse available fitness and wellness sessions and reserve them in just a few taps.
- Modern, intuitive design tailored for ease of use and a polished feel.
- Animations and transitions that enhance interaction, built entirely with SwiftUI.
This project allowed me to explore real-world app flows like booking logic, calendar integrations, and user onboarding—all while pushing my design and development skills further.
