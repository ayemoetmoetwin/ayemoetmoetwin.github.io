### 👋 Hi, I’m developing iOS applications passionate about coding and UI/UX design. 

Here is 👉 I work on some <b>AWESOME</b> projects!!

# [Mycomm MM](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mycomm-mm/id6680192119)
(Full-Time Work)
I've had the opportunity to contribute to the development of the MyComm MM iOS App, a community-focused platform. My work, using Swift and UIKit, includes:
- Refreshing and modernizing several key UI components to improve user experience.
- Implementing a new chat messaging feature to allow users to engage more actively with their community.
- Supporting the team with ongoing bug fixes and design enhancements to ensure smooth performance and visual consistency.
This is ongoing work, and the above are just a few highlights of my contributions so far.

# [Rezerve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rezerv-gym-wellness-sports/id1661249713)
My most recent app I built and released on the App Store. I created this app out of personal need. I have SO MANY random app ideas and wanted a place I could easily keep track of them. AppIdeasApp lets you create app ideas, brainstorm everything from name ideas, feature ideas, color schemes, and more. Less forgetting. More building. More shipping. I wanted to challenge my design skills on this project and had fun adding some animations (all with SwiftUI of course!)

# [CityNexus-Meet Me in the City](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/citynexus-meet-me-in-the-city/id1634174260)
This app has been a passion project of mine over the past couple years. Magic Budget is a Disney Parks budget planning app. Me and my husband absolutely love going to the parks but we always find ourselves coming over budget (too many churros). I built this app to help solve this problem! I found the estimated price for many of the popular items in the parks so users can quickly budget for what they might buy on their trip.
