### 👋 Hi! I'm a self-taught freelance/indie iOS Engineer. Here's a bit of what I've been working on.

# [Mycomm MM](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mycomm-mm/id6680192119)
(Contract Work)
I've have the opportunity to contribute to this incredible iOS/watchOS App. Using SwiftUI, I've helped refresh some of the designs, implement a new generic Calendar and Chart layer for users to add to their watch faces, and help with various bug fixes and design updates. This is ongoing work and just a few examples of the things I've had the opportunity to work on.

- 💬 Wrote a Python script to help with the app's localization
- 📊 Built a generic chart layer with SwiftCharts to handle the data and settings the User chooses to use
- 🔹 Helped add custom watch hands to the app usings custom SwiftUI Shapes
- 📲 Incorporated tap gestures to improve the watch face editor experience
- ⌚️ Added a watch band preview feature so users can see what their face could like like with popular band options"
- Other UI and bug fixes

# [Rezerve](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rezerv-gym-wellness-sports/id1661249713)
My most recent app I built and released on the App Store. I created this app out of personal need. I have SO MANY random app ideas and wanted a place I could easily keep track of them. AppIdeasApp lets you create app ideas, brainstorm everything from name ideas, feature ideas, color schemes, and more. Less forgetting. More building. More shipping. I wanted to challenge my design skills on this project and had fun adding some animations (all with SwiftUI of course!)

This app has been a passion project of mine over the past couple years. Magic Budget is a Disney Parks budget planning app. Me and my husband absolutely love going to the parks but we always find ourselves coming over budget (too many churros). I built this app to help solve this problem! I found the estimated price for many of the popular items in the parks so users can quickly budget for what they might buy on their trip.
